## Quick Start

Install > [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)

### Vue-CLI 3 is the next generation cli tool made to help you get started more easily than before. When you start your app with vue-cli you will also be able to get the official webpack updates and config changes, as well as Vuetify's updates without an arduous upgrade process.
```
$ yarn global add @vue/cli
// OR
$ npm install @vue/cli -g 	
```

### Once the cli is installed, you can generate a new project scaffold. Select the default install unless you have specific packages that you need to include (e.g. vuex or vue-router). This will create a new Vue project that's ready to go with your selected options.
```
$ vue create my-app
$ cd my-app
```

### Now that you have an instantiated project, you can add the [Vuetify package](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vue-cli-plugin-vuetify) using the cli.
```
vue add vuetify
```

### Keep in mind, if you are installing the Vuetify package on an existing vue-cli-3 project, ensure you have a clean working directory in case there are issues with the merge.

### install node modules

```
$ npm install
```

### After installation, you can run the dev npm script in package.json. This will start a local development server at https://localhost:8080.

```
$ yarn serve
// OR
$ npm run serve
```
